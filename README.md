A `/venmo` bot for [Slack](https://slack.com/).

Planned usage:

```
/venmo julian 1.00 thanks for signing us up for slack, this is dope
```

The first time you pay someone, if you haven't used it before, the bot will private message you an authentication link that uses Venmo's OAuth flow.

The bot will only send money to Slack user IDs it has a stored Venmo ID for.
